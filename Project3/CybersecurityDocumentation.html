        <p>What is Cyber Security? Cyber Security is a process that's designed to protect networks and devices from external threats. </p>
        <p>Businesses typically employ Cyber Security professionals to protect their confidential information, maintain employee productivity, and enhance customer confidence in products and services.</p>

        <header>Ethical Hacking</header>
        <p>Definition:
          Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.
        </p>
        <p>An ethical hacker reports the identified vulnerabilities to the organization. Additionally, they provide remediation advice. In many cases, with the organization’s consent, the ethical hacker performs a re-test to ensure the vulnerabilities are fully resolved. </p>

host = "192.168.0.187"

# subnet to target

# magic we'll check ICMP responses for
tgt_message = "PYTHONRULES!"

        <p>Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that focuses on identifying, acquiring, processing, analysing, and reporting on data stored electronically.</p>
        <p>Electronic evidence is a component of almost all criminal activities and digital forensics support is crucial for law enforcement investigations.</p>

        <header>Penetration Testing</header>
        <pA penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF).></p>
        <p>Pen testing can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems, (e.g., application protocol interfaces (APIs), frontend/backend servers) to uncover vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized inputs that are susceptible to code injection attacks.</p>

        <header>SQL injections</header>
        <p>SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.</p>
        <p>SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.</p>
        <pre><code>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;</code></pre>
